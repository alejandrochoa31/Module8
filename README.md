Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a client of Creative Technology Solutions who sought assistance in developing a web-based version of their Android game, Draw It or Lose It. Their key requirements 
included the ability to have one or more teams involved in the game, with each team having multiple players assigned to it. Additionally, they needed game and team names to be unique to 
facilitate user selection, and only one instance of the game could exist in memory at any given time. The software design needed to incorporate unique identifiers for each instance of the 
game, team, or player to achieve this.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I provided a thorough analysis and summary of the client's requirements, ensuring clarity and understanding of the project objectives.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Developing a design document helps understand the client's requirements, which is helpful for writing code that meets expectations.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the evaluation section i could be more through and maybe provide more information.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Interpreting the user's needs and putting them into the software design is essential for creating a solution that addresses their requirements. I reviewed the user's 
requirements, considering both requests and potential underlying needs. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

In designing software, I start by understanding the requirements thoroughly. Then i focus on creating user-friendly designs, balancing factors like scalability and security. I'll keep refining my approach to stay updated and deliver effective solutions.
